# Unused Node Cleaner
"Unused Node Cleaner" allows you to clean your blueprints from unused nodes that someone left somewhere and are still there to just distract you.

**WARNING:** While the "Hide Unused" toggle is on, the plugin will disable the "Hide Unrelated" feature as te plugin uses the same engine functions to make the nodes fade out.

## How to use

**Unused Node Cleaner** can be bought from the [Unreal Engine marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/unused-node-cleaner).

The plugin only adds two buttons to the Blueprint editor, but you can find more information and see it in action on the wiki [Getting started](https://github.com/Urkaz/UnusedNodeCleaner).

You can find answers for some frequently questions on the wiki: [FAQ](https://github.com/Urkaz/UnusedNodeCleaner).

And if you have some problem using the plugin, please create a new [Issue](https://github.com/Urkaz/UnusedNodeCleaner/issues/new/choose).
